This thing makes shopping for stuff without the grift a lot easier as well as selling 
software and other applications without the platform grift.
only ads be the doom that your eyes may face or a small gas fee for the data-mass from all the 
storage hosting. 

It even comes with social media and other links that help self advertisement. 

Affiliates - would get benefits like discounts, promoted ads and merch.
Like getting front paged on Fiverr.

Stalls - A very simple and elegant and modifyable layout for the shopper
to showcase their wares. No more boring layouts and links are more sharable 
than ever.

Events - Where people hold venues on their own for their own companies or name
can even (hold Stalls and) sell stuff right from the event or app event so people don't miss out 
even if they can't make it.
